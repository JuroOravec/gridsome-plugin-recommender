## Restrictions

**This plugin does not operate on the GraphQL Layer. Any content source that plugs in via GraphQL should not work with it.
Sources like gridsome-source-filesystem or @gridsome/vue-remark are working**


## Install

- `yarn add gridsome-plugin-recommender`
- `npm install gridsome-plugin-recommender --save`

## Getting Started

Example: Find similar blog posts based on the title.

```js
module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    {
      use: '@gridsome/source-filesystem',
      options: {
        path: 'content/posts/**/*.md',
        typeName: 'Post',
      },
    },
    {
      use: "gridsome-plugin-recommender",
      options: {
        enabled: true,
        typeName: 'Post',
        field: 'title',
        relatedFieldName: 'related',
        minScore: 0.01,
        maxScore: 1,
        minRelations:3,
        maxRelations: 10,
        fillWithRandom:false,
        debug: false
      }
    }
  ]
};
```

**Important notice: the plugin needs to be placed below your source plugins or otherwise no required collections are created before. 
[Issue-1342](https://github.com/gridsome/gridsome/issues/1342)**


In your **templates** use something like this

```
<page-query>
    query RelatedPosts {
      allPost(filter:{id:{eq:"current-post-id"}}) {
        edges {
          node {
            id
            related{
              id
              path
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
</page-query>
```




## Options

#### enabled

- Type: `boolean`

Enables / Disables the entire plugin. This might break your UI logic as the relations will be missing from
your nodes.

#### debug

- Type: `boolean`

Enables log messages

#### typeName

- Type: `string` _required_

The collection we want to use to create relations of similar nodes.

#### field

- Type: `[string]` _required_

The collection fields we want to analyze for similarities


#### relatedFieldName

- Type: `[string]`
- Default: related

The field attached to your GraphQl node containing the related objects.
Allows creating multiple relations per collection

#### minScore

- Type: `number` [0,1]
- Default: 0.01

Minimum score required to identify a relation between two nodes.

**This might need to be adjusted depending on your content length**


#### maxScore

- Type: `number` [0,1]
- Default: 1

Maximum score allowed to identify a relation between two nodes

#### minRelations

- Type: `number`
- Default: 3

Minimum relations to be produced. If the number of similar nodes is smaller than minRelations,
it will be filled with random items when fillWithRandom is enabled

#### maxRelations

- Type: `number`
- Default: 10

Maximum relations to be produced


#### fillWithRandom

- Type: `boolean`
- Default: false

Enables filling relations up to number of minRelations with random nodes

## Usage

large collections.
