2. Show related products the user might also be interested in in your shop
3. Save time by automatically tagging / categorizing your posts with related tags
4. Showing context-based ads / affiliate links on your post pages that relate to the content
5. Automatically generating tag / category indexes for your posts or products

## Restrictions

**This plugin does not operate on the GraphQL Layer. Any content source that plugs in via GraphQL should not work with it. 
It only works with source plugins that operate on the [Gridsome Data Store API](https://gridsome.org/docs/data-store-api/).
Tested with [gridsome-source-filesystem](https://gridsome.org/plugins/@gridsome/source-filesystem)**


## Install

- `yarn add gridsome-plugin-recommender`
- `npm install gridsome-plugin-recommender --save`

## Getting Started

Example: Find similar blog posts based on the title. You can find a more complex example on GitHub under /example

```js
module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    {
      use: '@gridsome/source-filesystem',
      options: {
        path: 'content/posts/**/*.md',
        typeName: 'Post',
      },
    },
    {
      use: "gridsome-plugin-recommender",
      options: {
        enabled: true,
        typeName: 'Post',
        referenceTypeName: 'Tag',
        field: 'title',
        referenceField: 'title',
        relatedFieldName: 'related',
        referenceRelatedFieldName: 'related',
        caseSensitive: false,
        minScore: 0.01,
        maxScore: 1,
        minRelations:3,
        maxRelations: 10,
        fillWithRandom:false,
        debug: false
      }
    }
  ]
};
```

**Important notice: the plugin needs to be placed below your source plugins or otherwise no required collections are created before. 
[Issue-1342](https://github.com/gridsome/gridsome/issues/1342)**


In your **templates** use something like this

```
<page-query>
    query RelatedPosts {
      allPost(filter:{id:{eq:"current-post-id"}}) {
        edges {
          node {
            id
            related{
              id
              path
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
</page-query>
```

your nodes.

#### debug

- Type: `boolean`

Enables log messages

#### typeName

- Type: `string` _required_

The default collection we want to use to create relations of similar nodes or reference nodes.

#### referenceTypeName

- Type: `string` _required_

The reference collection we want to use to create relations of default collection nodes.

#### field

- Type: `[string]` _required_

The collection field we want to analyze for similarities

#### referenceField

- Type: `[string]` _required_

The reference collection field we want to analyze for similarities

#### relatedFieldName

- Type: `[string]`
- Default: related

The field attached to your GraphQl node of the default collection containing the related objects.
Allows creating multiple relations per collection.

#### referenceRelatedFieldName

- Type: `[string]`
- Default: related

The field attached to your GraphQl node of the reference collection containing the related objects.
Allows creating multiple relations per collection.

#### minScore

- Type: `number` [0,1]
- Default: 0.01

**This might need to be adjusted depending on your content length**


#### maxScore

- Type: `number` [0,1]
- Default: 1

Maximum score allowed to identify a relation between two nodes

#### minRelations

it will be filled with random items when fillWithRandom is enabled

#### maxRelations

- Type: `number`
